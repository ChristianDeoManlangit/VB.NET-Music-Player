# VB.NET-Music-Player
This music player was developed as part of a programming class exercise, focused on recreating a familiar music interface (like Spotify) while implementing functional playback controls. Built entirely using Visual Basic, the project demonstrates how to create a smooth audio experience with clean UI interactions.
